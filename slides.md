## According to Gitlab:
## A code review is a peer review of code that helps developers ensure or improve the
## code quality before they merge and ship it.




## A better mental model:
## A code review is a way for a team to share knowledge, learn together and
## assess the quality of the code they are shipping before they ship it.




## Emphasize team growth and learning over code quality.
## Code quality follows from team quality




## Lots of research backs up the importance of teamwork on software development
### Leave it as an exercise for the audience, good place to start:

## I want to convince you that code reviews can be the pathway to a better team
